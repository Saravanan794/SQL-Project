# Retail Sales Analysis

This project provides insights into retail sales data by analyzing key metrics such as sales performance, product trends, regional performance, and more. The analysis is performed using SQL queries on a sales database that contains historical transaction data.

## Features

- Analyze sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Compare performance across different regions and stores.
- Identify top-selling products and product categories.
- Determine sales performance by customer demographics (if available).
- Generate key metrics like total revenue, average order value, and sales growth.
- Export the analysis results for reporting purposes.

## Requirements

- SQL-compatible database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or any other preferred client)

## Setup

1. **Database Setup:**
   
   - Import the provided retail sales dataset (or connect to your own database) to begin the analysis. The dataset should include tables such as `sales`, `products`, `customers`, `stores`, and `regions`.

   Example schema:
   - `sales`: Transaction data (transaction ID, customer ID, store ID, product ID, quantity, price, date, etc.)
   - `products`: Product details (product ID, name, category, etc.)
   - `customers`: Customer details (customer ID, demographic info, etc.)
   - `stores`: Store details (store ID, location, region, etc.)
   - `regions`: Regional details (region ID, name)

2. **Importing Data (if applicable):**
   
   If you're using your own dataset, ensure the tables are created and populated with data that follows a similar structure to the above schema. You can use the following sample SQL commands for table creation:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
       product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       product_name VARCHAR(255),
       category VARCHAR(255),
       price DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );

   CREATE TABLE sales (
       transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       customer_id INT,
       store_id INT,
       product_id INT,
       quantity INT,
       sale_date DATE,
       total_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
       FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
   );
   
   -- Add more table creation scripts for customers, stores, etc.
   ```

## Example SQL Queries

Below are examples of SQL queries to analyze the sales data:

1. **Total Sales by Month**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       YEAR(sale_date) AS year,
       MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
       SUM(total_price) AS total_sales
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
   ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC;
   ```

2. **Top 5 Selling Products**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       p.product_name,
       SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
       SUM(s.total_price) AS total_sales
   FROM sales s
   JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
   GROUP BY p.product_name
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Sales by Region**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       r.region_name,
       SUM(s.total_price) AS total_sales
   FROM sales s
   JOIN stores st ON s.store_id = st.store_id
   JOIN regions r ON st.region_id = r.region_id
   GROUP BY r.region_name
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
   ```

4. **Average Order Value**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       AVG(total_price) AS average_order_value
   FROM sales;
   ```

5. **Sales Performance Over Time** (Weekly or Monthly):

   ```sql
   SELECT
       YEAR(sale_date) AS year,
       WEEK(sale_date) AS week,
       SUM(total_price) AS total_sales
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), WEEK(sale_date)
   ORDER BY year DESC, week DESC;
   ```

## Usage

1. **Import the dataset** into your SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) or connect to your own database.
2. **Run the SQL queries** provided in the `queries/` folder to analyze different aspects of the sales data.
3. **Export the results** for reporting purposes (e.g., CSV, Excel, PDF).
4. **Generate visual reports** (optional, using BI tools like Power BI or Tableau) for deeper insights.

## Notes

- Customize the queries as needed to match your dataset structure or specific business requirements.
- Be mindful of data privacy and compliance laws when handling customer or transaction data.
- If using an external tool for reporting, you can export query results as CSV or Excel files.
